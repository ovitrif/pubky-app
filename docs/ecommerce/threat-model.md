# Pubky Marketplace Threat Model

Status: active
Reviewed baseline: 2026-08-19

## Scope

This threat model covers:

- Pubky App marketplace browser/PWA;
- Next.js server routes used as a narrow browser-facing proxy;
- Marketplace Transaction Service and PostgreSQL;
- Pubky homeserver/Nexus public catalog data;
- Locks browser SDK, Lock Server, and its PostgreSQL database;
- Paykit Server, Paykit private messaging, Bitkit, Electrum, and Bitcoin observations;
- sandbox tax, shipping, payment, hold/release, and payout adapters;
- support, moderator, risk, finance, and operator interfaces.

The prototype is non-custodial. Real-funds production, legal escrow, regulated payouts, card processing, KYC/KYB, tax remittance, and production fraud/compliance operations remain outside the accepted security boundary until separately designed and reviewed.

## Security objectives

1. A user can act only as their authenticated Pubky identity and authorized role.
2. A user can access only public data or private objects in which they are an authorized participant.
3. One unit, accepted offer, auction, order, payment fact, refund, and ledger posting cannot be created twice.
4. The browser cannot forge price, inventory, winner, settlement, refund, guarantee, or payout facts.
5. Public Pubky records cannot expose private commerce data.
6. Pubky secrets, wallet secrets, xpubs, Paykit/Locks secrets, bearer credentials, delivery details, messages, and evidence do not enter telemetry.
7. Every staff action is least-privileged, reasoned, attributable, immutable, and reviewable.
8. A failed dependency, delayed event, restart, replay, or restore fails safely without inventing finality.
9. Digital content is released only after a valid Locks entitlement and hash verification.
10. Supply-chain and runtime configuration are pinned, validated, and fail closed.

Assumptions:

- Browser code, local storage, IndexedDB, service workers, extensions, and client clocks are untrusted.
- Next.js route handlers may be restarted or replicated and are not transaction authority.
- Public homeserver/Nexus data is untrusted until schema, owner, path, and revision/source are validated.
- External callbacks are untrusted until signature, audience, timestamp/replay window, and correlation are validated.
- Locks and Paykit are pre-production dependencies whose current documented limitations are enforced in product policy.

### Prohibited public data

- address, email, phone, precise location;
- order/cart identifiers that permit enumeration;
- private offer, bid maximum, message, or evidence;
- payment address/hash/correlation;
- `bundle_id`, access credential, creator frontend session;
- staff note, risk signal, device/network linkage;
- raw Pubky auth assertion or session export.

### Telemetry policy

Telemetry may include:

- opaque deployment, trace, aggregate-type, and internal correlation IDs;
- coarse result/error code;
- latency, queue depth, revision-conflict count, invariant counters;
- adapter name/version and redacted health.

Telemetry must not include user-authored content, private identifiers, public keys/URLs, payment values tied to an identity, delivery details, evidence, credentials, raw callback bodies, or cryptographic material.

## Abuse and failure policy

- Risk signals create review/hold states; they do not silently change auction ordering, payment facts, ledger history, or review text.
- A dependency timeout is distinct from a negative business result.
- Unknown payment/refund outcomes remain reconciling and block release/payout simulation.
- Rate limiting must not make exact idempotent replay unsafe.
- Deleted/suspended public content remains available only to authorized order/dispute participants and staff.
- Every user-facing guarantee names its sandbox or independently verified basis.

## Required security verification

### Automated

- contract fuzz/property tests for closed schemas, bounds, money, revisions, and canonical replay;
- object-level authorization matrix across buyer, seller, unrelated user, support, moderator, risk, finance, and operator;
- 100-way stock and bid concurrency;
- duplicate, changed, reordered, delayed, and forged commands/callbacks;
- CSRF, origin, audience, expiry, nonce, unsafe redirect, SSRF, and path traversal;
- upload MIME/signature/size/dimension/decompression/metadata cases;
- ledger balance, refund ceiling, one-winner, one-payment, and review uniqueness constraints;
- Locks/Paykit unsigned route, pending failure, late completion, credential secrecy, and content hash cases;
- log/Sentry/analytics/browser-storage redaction scanning;
- migration failure, worker crash, dead-letter replay, backup, and isolated restore.

### Manual

- Pubky Ring creator grant scope and cancellation;
- Bitkit/helper setup without xpub exposure to Pubky App;
- desktop/mobile setup and payment-progress language;
- keyboard and screen-reader completion of purchase, fulfillment, return, and dispute;
- support/moderation redaction and role separation;
- browser storage inspection before/after sign-out and account switch;
- successful payment followed by late/duplicate/restart reconciliation;
- security headers, setup iframe policy, deep links, and unsafe-link warnings.

### Independent review gates

Before real funds:

- review current Locks, Paykit, Paykit Server, Bitkit, Homeserver, and generated WASM revisions;
- cryptographic and protocol review;
- web/API penetration test;
- infrastructure/secrets/backup review;
- legal review of payment, guarantee, refund, tax, shipping, privacy, moderation, and records language;
- incident response and responsible disclosure process.

## Residual risks

- The Marketplace Transaction Service is a centralized prototype sequencer.
- Locks and Paykit Server are pre-production and may change without migration compatibility.
- Paykit Server is single-process, on-chain-only, and cannot refund.
- Anonymous/bearer-compatible Locks credentials can be shared if stolen.
- Public catalog records and private transaction projections can temporarily diverge.
- Fraud, prohibited goods, counterfeit detection, tax, carrier, guarantee, payout, and chargeback behavior remain sandbox/manual.

These risks must remain visible in runtime configuration, operator documentation, and user-facing labels. They cannot be converted into “accepted” production guarantees solely because prototype tests pass.
